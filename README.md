spopsh
======
Spotify is great (sort of), but a minimalist keyboard guy needs their minimalist keyboard client. I found [spop](https://github.com/Schnouki/spop), which is quite awesome if I may say so, but the telnet shell thing bummed me out, I'm not much for dmenu, and I should really be programming more than I am, so I'm making spopsh for myself and using it as a means to get a great contribution history on GitHub; win win win!

Warning
------
This is a hobby project and is thus liable to be completely and utterly abandoned at any moment, but, as long as Spotify keeps libspotify alive enough for spop to be a thing, spopsh should be a thing, I hope, but not promise.
Oh, and never ever in a million years expect things to just work! They might, and when they do, joyous wonder will be experienced by all, but if something is utterly broken... it's utterly broken.
